1
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:17,008
(They said a good thing about summer is that days are longer than nights.)

2
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,137
(We can see things better in the season.)

3
00:00:21,117 --> 00:00:24,410
Okay, pack the equipment. I have the records of all students.

4
00:00:26,481 --> 00:00:30,216
(But that’s not the case for an invisible man like me.)

5
00:00:31,312 --> 00:00:32,721
Master.

6
00:00:35,928 --> 00:00:37,608
I’m Nontarat.

7
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,500
I’m Master Mac. Nice to meet you.

8
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,202
Not that, Master.

9
00:00:47,828 --> 00:00:49,405
You haven’t written my record in.

10
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:53,905
Your name is not here, Nuntarit.

11
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:57,004
I’m Nontarat. Let me...

12
00:00:58,670 --> 00:00:59,371
Here.

13
00:01:03,828 --> 00:01:07,508
(Whether it’s day or night, summer or winter.)

14
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,708
(I’m still invisible to everyone.)

15
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,814
(They said high school is a memorable moment of your life.)

16
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,340
(You get to enjoy a small circle of friends.)

17
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:21,480
(But I’m nobody and completely invisible.)

18
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,537
(Until…)

19
00:02:58,988 --> 00:02:59,767
Eight.

20
00:03:00,484 --> 00:03:01,219
Nine.

21
00:03:01,608 --> 00:03:02,336
Ten.

22
00:03:02,927 --> 00:03:05,657
Those who are late are the same old faces.

23
00:03:05,703 --> 00:03:06,546
(My name is Lune.)

24
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,705
(I just moved to this school last semester.)

25
00:03:09,537 --> 00:03:12,106
(As you see, nobody pays attention to me.)

26
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:15,451
(Although I’m invisible in their eyes,

27
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:19,100
I’m happy that I can live a quiet and simple life.)

28
00:03:20,724 --> 00:03:21,856
I arrived first.

29
00:03:21,964 --> 00:03:23,254
You need to do the homework for me.

30
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:26,060
(That’s White, the school’s golden boy.)

31
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:29,122
(It’s like he has a spotlight following him everywhere.)

32
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,922
(He’s smart, good-looking, and popular among girls in the school.)

33
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,970
Look at my hand. I arrived first.

34
00:03:38,202 --> 00:03:40,213
(The guy who’s racing against White is Jewel.)

35
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,075
(He’s known for his good looks and wealthy family.)

36
00:03:47,857 --> 00:03:50,805
(It said that he has never dated any girl for long.)

37
00:03:54,654 --> 00:03:56,847
(These two are always together.)

38
00:04:02,277 --> 00:04:03,868
Why the heck are you two always bickering?

39
00:04:04,122 --> 00:04:06,201
I’m the one who did the homework. Are you going to copy it?

40
00:04:06,488 --> 00:04:07,414
- Yes. - Yes.

41
00:04:07,608 --> 00:04:10,416
(That’s Ivy, the boldest girl in the school.)

42
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,151
What the hell are you looking at?

43
00:04:16,462 --> 00:04:17,666
Go away, perverts.

44
00:04:17,681 --> 00:04:19,417
(Even the senior students are afraid of her.)

45
00:04:19,432 --> 00:04:20,610
Go away.

46
00:04:24,237 --> 00:04:25,179
What the hell are you looking at?

47
00:04:26,582 --> 00:04:29,608
(They are the school’s aces who are in my class.)

48
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:34,235
- (These three are not the person I’m waiting for.)
- Hello, everyone.

49
00:04:34,623 --> 00:04:35,620
(That person is…)

50
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,165
(Star.)

51
00:04:43,088 --> 00:04:44,909
(She’s the star that I’ve been watching.)

52
00:04:56,718 --> 00:04:58,500
(She’s the school’s perfect golden girl.)

53
00:05:00,654 --> 00:05:01,625
(Her family is rich.)

54
00:05:05,318 --> 00:05:06,703
You have one hour.

55
00:05:07,157 --> 00:05:07,906
Start.

56
00:05:08,548 --> 00:05:09,564
(She’s a top student.)

57
00:05:10,361 --> 00:05:11,014
I’m done.

58
00:05:21,623 --> 00:05:22,506
(She’s an excellent athlete.)

59
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,302
(Many boys are interested in her.)

60
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,207
My friend asked me to give this to you.

61
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:36,503
Who is this friend of yours?

62
00:05:37,734 --> 00:05:39,454
(But Ivy always interposes between Star and the boys.)

63
00:05:39,512 --> 00:05:40,602
Why don’t you show us the chicken dance?

64
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,881
The dance that you told us to do in the hazing.

65
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,438
Go for it, buddy.

66
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:50,654
Grilled chicken, grilled chicken

67
00:05:50,931 --> 00:05:53,408
It’s getting skewered, it’s getting skewered

68
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,576
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

69
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,539
White and Star are a match made in heaven.

70
00:06:05,348 --> 00:06:08,007
(Many people get to stand next to Star.)

71
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:12,277
(But I’m happy to watch her from afar.)

72
00:06:16,394 --> 00:06:19,004
(Even though she doesn’t notice my existence.)

73
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:40,960
Well done, Star.

74
00:06:41,588 --> 00:06:42,909
Isn’t that too obvious?

75
00:06:43,004 --> 00:06:44,608
What the heck is wrong with you?

76
00:06:44,785 --> 00:06:46,905
Our friend wins. It’s normal to congratulate her.

77
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,312
Friend?

78
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:52,385
I’ll pray for you to stay friends with her forever.

79
00:06:52,398 --> 00:06:53,751
You, rascal.

80
00:06:57,638 --> 00:06:58,414
Come on.

81
00:07:01,562 --> 00:07:03,465
Star, I bought this for you.

82
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:07,373
Athletes don’t drink water from a random stranger.

83
00:07:09,608 --> 00:07:10,862
Who is a stranger?

84
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:11,422
You are.

85
00:07:12,293 --> 00:07:15,180
I started to wonder why you always step in between me and Star.

86
00:07:15,564 --> 00:07:18,029
Are you having feelings…

87
00:07:18,081 --> 00:07:19,549
for…

88
00:07:23,562 --> 00:07:24,490
Are you having feelings for me?

89
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:27,404
Don’t be so full of yourself.

90
00:07:27,558 --> 00:07:30,016
I will never let my friend be close to a dangerous man like you.

91
00:07:30,162 --> 00:07:31,714
I’m only dangerous to...

92
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,417
...you.

93
00:07:34,847 --> 00:07:35,943
Damn it, White. You want to do this.

94
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:38,290
That’s enough. Stop it, you two.

95
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,302
There you go.

96
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:40,712
Jewel, help me.

97
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:41,505
Help what?

98
00:07:42,874 --> 00:07:43,558
Star, step aside.

99
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,176
Let’s run.

100
00:07:46,457 --> 00:07:47,065
Go, go.

101
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,071
Come back here.

102
00:07:49,645 --> 00:07:51,112
He’s the one who started it, not him.

103
00:07:58,059 --> 00:07:58,811
Star.

104
00:08:35,358 --> 00:08:36,111
Are you okay?

105
00:08:37,234 --> 00:08:38,088
Yes, I’m okay.

106
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:38,739
Wait.

107
00:08:41,148 --> 00:08:43,266
Jewel, have you ever seen him?

108
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,773
- Do you have a wide-angle shot? - Yes.

109
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,656
That’s exactly what I want.

110
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:46,552
Can you send it to me?

111
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:50,220
Rascal, come with me.

112
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,106
Send it to me now.

113
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:54,022
Damn.

114
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:56,737
Your lips were stuck together.

115
00:08:56,748 --> 00:08:59,348
Damn it, Jewel. Stop watching it.

116
00:09:00,296 --> 00:09:01,404
Who is he?

117
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,634
The man who got my friend’s first kiss.

118
00:09:04,736 --> 00:09:05,791
Jewel, delete it!

119
00:09:05,816 --> 00:09:07,048
I’m begging you.

120
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,552
Come on.

121
00:09:24,888 --> 00:09:25,906
- Damn! - Damn!

122
00:09:40,085 --> 00:09:40,820
Damn!

123
00:09:41,703 --> 00:09:42,414
Are you a new student?

124
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,407
I’m actually in your class.

125
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,025
Really?

126
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,324
Tiwakorn.

127
00:09:51,053 --> 00:09:52,037
Tiwakorn.

128
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:53,514
I’m here.

129
00:09:54,318 --> 00:09:56,216
Okay. I have called everyone’s name, right?

130
00:09:56,428 --> 00:09:58,506
Didn’t you say you were in my class?

131
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,005
Why didn’t the teacher call your name…

132
00:10:13,854 --> 00:10:14,604
This is weird.

133
00:10:15,358 --> 00:10:16,859
Why have I never seen you before?

134
00:10:17,222 --> 00:10:19,620
It’s not strange. I usually don’t hang out with anyone.

135
00:10:21,171 --> 00:10:22,401
I feel comfortable with being alone.

136
00:10:31,117 --> 00:10:31,739
What?

137
00:10:31,754 --> 00:10:32,414
That’s not good.

138
00:10:33,189 --> 00:10:33,899
Trust me.

139
00:10:37,102 --> 00:10:38,309
If you don’t have any friends,

140
00:10:39,082 --> 00:10:40,411
you can hang out with us.

141
00:10:42,816 --> 00:10:43,807
Or…

142
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,408
I’ll make sure everyone knows you.

143
00:10:54,608 --> 00:10:55,456
Everyone.

144
00:10:56,414 --> 00:10:58,242
What are you doing, Tiwakorn?

145
00:10:58,499 --> 00:11:01,505
I want to introduce…

146
00:11:05,954 --> 00:11:06,601
Oh.

147
00:11:11,414 --> 00:11:12,040
Irin.

148
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:12,749
I’m here.

149
00:11:13,336 --> 00:11:14,117
Darika.

150
00:11:14,388 --> 00:11:15,054
I’m here.

151
00:11:15,807 --> 00:11:16,617
Tiwakorn.

152
00:11:16,727 --> 00:11:17,392
I’m here.

153
00:11:20,077 --> 00:11:20,814
Master.

154
00:11:21,811 --> 00:11:23,656
You haven’t called Nontarat’s name.

155
00:11:26,662 --> 00:11:27,280
Sorry.

156
00:11:27,456 --> 00:11:28,677
Nontarat, are you here?

157
00:11:34,023 --> 00:11:35,207
Master!

158
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:36,792
How can you turn off the light?

159
00:11:36,854 --> 00:11:38,382
My friend hasn’t finished packing his stuff.

160
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,674
He also pays the same tuition fees.

161
00:11:39,687 --> 00:11:42,174
You are causing him a trauma.

162
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,485
I’m sorry.

163
00:11:43,525 --> 00:11:44,961
Turn it on.

164
00:11:46,711 --> 00:11:47,712
The light is on.

165
00:11:51,896 --> 00:11:53,219
Give it to me.

166
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,494
Give it to me.

167
00:11:55,518 --> 00:11:57,115
Lune, hurry up. Come on.

168
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,367
You almost reached it.

169
00:11:58,828 --> 00:11:59,718
Come on. Faster.

170
00:11:59,731 --> 00:12:01,259
- Faster.
- Faster.

171
00:12:03,651 --> 00:12:05,869
Yeah.

172
00:12:14,343 --> 00:12:17,571
Hey, don’t you see it almost hit my friend’s head?

173
00:12:17,597 --> 00:12:19,208
Why are you acting like children? We’re not kids anymore.

174
00:12:20,321 --> 00:12:21,442
Damn it.

175
00:12:22,272 --> 00:12:23,040
Jewel, come on.

176
00:12:33,317 --> 00:12:35,257
Your drawing looks great.

177
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:36,994
Do you want to help me work on background art?

178
00:12:37,998 --> 00:12:40,108
I’m joining a comic contest.

179
00:12:40,162 --> 00:12:40,814
No.

180
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:43,810
You shot it down right away.

181
00:12:44,154 --> 00:12:45,906
Can I ask you something?

182
00:12:46,697 --> 00:12:47,164
Why do you…

183
00:12:47,173 --> 00:12:48,592
Why do I want to get to know you?

184
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,512
Yes.

185
00:12:56,771 --> 00:12:58,386
Maybe because…

186
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,605
You are my first kiss.

187
00:13:07,016 --> 00:13:07,797
I’m kidding.

188
00:13:11,122 --> 00:13:14,752
I just see myself in you.

189
00:13:19,671 --> 00:13:23,511
You know I was a troubled kid.

190
00:13:24,434 --> 00:13:26,468
No one wanted to hang out with me.

191
00:13:27,878 --> 00:13:29,982
Until someone came into my life.

192
00:13:30,665 --> 00:13:32,164
After that, my life has changed completely.

193
00:13:40,471 --> 00:13:42,105
You are not invisible.

194
00:13:43,235 --> 00:13:45,994
For me, you are…

195
00:13:48,844 --> 00:13:49,906
a secret character.

196
00:13:52,573 --> 00:13:53,327
What?

197
00:13:53,954 --> 00:13:57,405
The secret characters are always important.

198
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:08,102
I really want to be your friend.

199
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,309
Does he mean it?

200
00:15:07,425 --> 00:15:08,320
You are lying on top of me.

201
00:15:10,011 --> 00:15:10,765
Sorry.

202
00:15:13,952 --> 00:15:14,614
It’s okay.

203
00:15:17,106 --> 00:15:18,014
Star, are you alright?

204
00:15:20,801 --> 00:15:22,100
You know me?

205
00:15:25,971 --> 00:15:27,071
Which class are you in?

206
00:15:27,222 --> 00:15:28,102
I…

207
00:15:31,622 --> 00:15:33,204
Actually, we are in the same class.

208
00:15:35,992 --> 00:15:37,440
Really?

209
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,922
What’s your name?

210
00:15:39,558 --> 00:15:40,179
Lune.

211
00:15:41,728 --> 00:15:44,592
Lune as in the moon?

212
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,060
I’m Star.

213
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:52,527
You already knew my name.

214
00:15:59,202 --> 00:16:00,561
It’s quite nice up here.

215
00:16:03,285 --> 00:16:05,011
I’ve never come up here before.

216
00:16:07,979 --> 00:16:09,411
Why did you come here?

217
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:16,718
I heard people leave stuff they don’t want here.

218
00:16:17,248 --> 00:16:19,155
I want something. So I came here to look for it.

219
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:24,207
But now I’m more interested in the view from here.

220
00:16:31,943 --> 00:16:33,662
Lune, what are you doing here?

221
00:16:35,448 --> 00:16:38,112
It’s chaotic down there. So I like to come up here.

222
00:16:38,408 --> 00:16:39,065
Really?

223
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:41,211
That’s good.

224
00:16:49,231 --> 00:16:51,321
From now on, I will come to hide here too.

225
00:16:53,665 --> 00:16:56,708
Can I share the rooftop with you?

226
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,868
Next time you come here, don’t forget to block the door from closing.

227
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:08,967
The door cannot be opened from this side.

228
00:17:10,373 --> 00:17:11,020
Huh?!

229
00:17:12,367 --> 00:17:13,090
Really?

230
00:17:13,614 --> 00:17:14,309
I…

231
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:15,825
Don’t tell me that you…

232
00:17:17,362 --> 00:17:18,143
I…

233
00:17:20,752 --> 00:17:21,422
I’m kidding.

234
00:17:47,211 --> 00:17:48,217
Eighteen.

235
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,484
Nineteen.

236
00:17:50,425 --> 00:17:51,515
Twenty.

237
00:17:51,586 --> 00:17:54,622
You finish squats. Go run some laps.

238
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:55,511
Go.

239
00:17:56,829 --> 00:17:58,404
Hey, Lune.

240
00:18:00,567 --> 00:18:02,580
There you are.

241
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,405
Is this your first time being punished?

242
00:18:06,915 --> 00:18:08,520
Master usually didn’t see me.

243
00:18:09,952 --> 00:18:13,928
So now we are the first person for each other.

244
00:18:15,725 --> 00:18:17,909
Can you stop talking about being the first person for each other?

245
00:18:20,715 --> 00:18:21,816
You have to run five more laps, right?

246
00:18:22,588 --> 00:18:24,980
I almost finish my laps but I’ll run with you.

247
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,112
Go.

248
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:26,848
Come on.

249
00:18:27,508 --> 00:18:28,674
Is that a good thing?

250
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:30,354
Of course, it’s a good thing.

251
00:18:31,106 --> 00:18:32,875
I’ll see it as an exercise.

252
00:18:35,746 --> 00:18:37,808
I mean if it’s a good thing to be your friend.

253
00:18:39,517 --> 00:18:41,574
After completing the laps, I’ll take you to the Art Scrap room.

254
00:18:42,035 --> 00:18:42,696
Huh?

255
00:18:43,737 --> 00:18:44,540
What room?

256
00:18:47,508 --> 00:18:49,328
This is the room I told you.

257
00:18:51,426 --> 00:18:53,311
Everyone, this is my new friend.

258
00:18:53,712 --> 00:18:54,620
His name is Lune.

259
00:18:57,808 --> 00:18:58,668
Hey, Lune.

260
00:19:02,367 --> 00:19:04,045
Star, do you know Lune?

261
00:19:05,659 --> 00:19:07,007
Good.

262
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,706
This is Jewel.

263
00:19:11,481 --> 00:19:12,345
Je-hell.

264
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,345
I’m Jewel.

265
00:19:14,675 --> 00:19:15,365
This is Lune.

266
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,441
Jewel is on my team for the comic contest.

267
00:19:17,549 --> 00:19:20,699
He often skips classes to hang out here.

268
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:25,056
Star likes to come here to design clothes.

269
00:19:25,257 --> 00:19:27,379
That’s right. I want to be a designer.

270
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,788
This is Ivy.

271
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,056
She often comes here to…

272
00:19:36,813 --> 00:19:37,595
What are you doing here?

273
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:39,725
I’m here to protect Star from you guys.

274
00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:45,797
Lune, if you don’t have classes, you can come here.

275
00:19:46,106 --> 00:19:49,070
I have the key. Master gave this room to me.

276
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,173
He just doesn’t want to open the room for you every day.

277
00:19:52,034 --> 00:19:54,570
This dude used to be a troubled kid.

278
00:19:54,588 --> 00:19:58,074
So he was ordered to come here and clean the scraps in this room every day.

279
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,582
Though they are scraps, they are art.

280
00:20:01,604 --> 00:20:06,656
They put effort into creating these artworks but they couldn’t finish them.

281
00:20:06,823 --> 00:20:07,951
They were stored in this room.

282
00:20:08,062 --> 00:20:09,700
So you call this room “Scrap Art”.

283
00:20:09,717 --> 00:20:12,287
I already told him the ending because I’m sick of hearing the story.

284
00:20:14,176 --> 00:20:16,619
Where have you been? Why have I never seen you before?

285
00:20:18,908 --> 00:20:20,710
Now, you see him.

286
00:20:22,642 --> 00:20:23,414
Fine.

287
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:24,733
Your name is Lune, right?

288
00:20:26,377 --> 00:20:28,407
Lune, what does your name mean?

289
00:20:29,189 --> 00:20:29,835
It’s a unique name.

290
00:20:30,675 --> 00:20:33,854
Your name is so ordinary, Jewel.

291
00:20:33,995 --> 00:20:34,896
No, no, no.

292
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,328
It’s Jewel.

293
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,226
Jewel.

294
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,414
Yeah, you know “Jewel”.

295
00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:42,112
Lune means the moon.

296
00:20:43,045 --> 00:20:45,106
That’s called the moon.

297
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,413
He’s funny.

298
00:20:47,555 --> 00:20:49,017
He doesn’t play jokes much but they are always funny.

299
00:20:49,146 --> 00:20:49,940
It’s not a joke.

300
00:20:50,594 --> 00:20:54,204
I’m sorry for his stupidity.

301
00:20:54,908 --> 00:20:57,374
Lune means the moon in the French language.

302
00:20:57,813 --> 00:20:58,620
Do you know it?

303
00:20:59,921 --> 00:21:02,401
Damn. I just learned it.

304
00:21:02,477 --> 00:21:04,118
Me too.

305
00:21:04,143 --> 00:21:06,903
No, I just learned that you are quite smart.

306
00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:10,251
I thought you were only good at using force

307
00:21:10,263 --> 00:21:11,374
Then I’ll show you my force.

308
00:21:11,407 --> 00:21:12,588
Ouch.

309
00:21:15,348 --> 00:21:16,228
Jewel, help me.

310
00:21:17,189 --> 00:21:18,059
Don’t call me.

311
00:21:18,265 --> 00:21:18,696
Jewel.

312
00:21:18,702 --> 00:21:19,702
Leave me out of it.

313
00:21:21,576 --> 00:21:25,013
(I’m happy with being alone.)

314
00:21:25,837 --> 00:21:29,721
(But sometimes being with people may not be a bad thing.)

315
00:21:33,737 --> 00:21:34,580
Hello, June.

316
00:21:35,388 --> 00:21:36,478
I’m free today.

317
00:21:37,114 --> 00:21:38,173
Do you want to have dinner with me?

318
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,111
I’m waiting for my ride.

319
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,705
Do you want to come with me?

320
00:21:45,811 --> 00:21:47,780
- Éclair. - Didn’t you tell me you have dinner with your family today?

321
00:21:48,411 --> 00:21:50,312
You are a scumbag like they say.

322
00:21:50,383 --> 00:21:51,515
June is my sister.

323
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:52,422
You are an only child.

324
00:21:54,109 --> 00:21:54,906
You knew that?

325
00:21:56,693 --> 00:22:01,534
Excuse me. Did you order peach tea with crystal pearl bubba?

326
00:22:01,681 --> 00:22:02,328
Yes.

327
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,471
But I’m not eating it.

328
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:07,611
Do you want a straw?

329
00:22:34,863 --> 00:22:35,508
Hey, you.

330
00:22:35,579 --> 00:22:36,154
Hey.

331
00:22:36,576 --> 00:22:37,121
Hey.

332
00:22:37,299 --> 00:22:38,514
Hey, you need to pay for the drink.

333
00:22:39,377 --> 00:22:40,071
Hey.

334
00:22:41,081 --> 00:22:41,675
Hey.

335
00:22:41,745 --> 00:22:42,254
Hey.

336
00:22:46,644 --> 00:22:47,779
Why are you following me?

337
00:22:47,871 --> 00:22:50,422
You haven’t paid for the drink.

338
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,531
I didn’t order it.

339
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:53,402
But...

340
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,219
the drink is on you.

341
00:22:56,604 --> 00:22:58,859
I’m afraid to ask her to pay for it.

342
00:22:59,474 --> 00:23:01,222
She looks very furious.

343
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,102
It almost got into your eyes.

344
00:23:34,576 --> 00:23:35,268
How much?

345
00:23:38,736 --> 00:23:42,817
You can pay with a transfer but you need to go to the café to scan the QR code.

346
00:23:44,992 --> 00:23:46,404
I don’t want to go there. Just keep the change.

347
00:23:46,613 --> 00:23:49,549
But the drink is only 50 baht.

348
00:23:51,441 --> 00:23:52,863
What’s wrong with him?

349
00:23:53,389 --> 00:23:54,207
Why did he give me 1,000 baht?

350
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,010
(The Scrap Art Group.)

351
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,730
(White : Everyone, let’s welcome our friend, Lune.)

352
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,810
(Ivy : When did Lune think you are his friend?)

353
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,582
(Jewel : Thank you, Ivy, for asking the question. I’m kidding. @Lune)

354
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:18,530
(Did you see White’s photo post? He’s so cute.)
(Jewel : Thank you, Ivy, for asking the question. I’m kidding. @Lune)

355
00:24:18,531 --> 00:24:21,554
(Did you see White’s photo post? He’s so cute.)

356
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,508
(Do you see the guy who often hangs out with White lately?)

357
00:24:24,592 --> 00:24:25,734
(I’m not talking about Jewel.)

358
00:24:25,925 --> 00:24:27,148
(The one who looks shy.)

359
00:24:27,164 --> 00:24:27,979
(Yes, him.)

360
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,054
(I saw him.)

361
00:24:29,311 --> 00:24:30,001
Who is he?

362
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:33,807
I don’t know but he doesn’t fit into the group.

363
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,605
He doesn’t have the aura.

364
00:24:36,087 --> 00:24:37,000
That’s right.

365
00:24:37,361 --> 00:24:40,388
This is a group of popular kids.

366
00:24:40,419 --> 00:24:41,602
Anyone wants to be their friend.

367
00:24:43,204 --> 00:24:45,703
White is so cute.

368
00:24:48,761 --> 00:24:49,659
Hello, Dad.

369
00:24:50,278 --> 00:24:51,699
I can go home by myself.

370
00:24:52,205 --> 00:24:52,848
Bye.

371
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:58,011
Lune, long time no see.

372
00:25:08,533 --> 00:25:10,374
Hey, where are you going?

373
00:25:24,546 --> 00:25:25,742
You got home right after the dinner was ready.

374
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,179
You must have a nose for it.

375
00:25:27,725 --> 00:25:28,709
I’m not hungry.

376
00:25:28,911 --> 00:25:29,911
I already had snacks with my friends.

377
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:31,911
Friends?!

378
00:25:32,247 --> 00:25:33,339
Why are you yelling?

379
00:25:34,364 --> 00:25:38,370
Why don’t you invite them to have dinner or sleep over here?

380
00:25:38,983 --> 00:25:40,589
Dad, they won’t come.

381
00:25:42,965 --> 00:25:44,404
I’m not sure I can call them my friends.

382
00:25:45,174 --> 00:25:45,859
Why?

383
00:25:46,674 --> 00:25:48,102
It’s nothing. Forget it.

384
00:25:49,522 --> 00:25:51,505
You have to have dinner alone today. Don’t cry.

385
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,505
I’ll go take a shower.

386
00:25:53,663 --> 00:25:55,617
You can go have dinner with your friends sometimes.

387
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,580
I ran out of grasses to cook your dinner.

388
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,256
Dad.

389
00:26:22,228 --> 00:26:22,831
Lune.

390
00:26:24,068 --> 00:26:25,271
Long time no see.

391
00:26:26,072 --> 00:26:27,271
Where are you going?

392
00:26:39,309 --> 00:26:40,921
Are you the guy who tries to get close with Sera?

393
00:26:41,371 --> 00:26:42,460
Come out and talk to me.

394
00:26:42,595 --> 00:26:43,914
Don’t you like to be the center of attention?

395
00:26:43,934 --> 00:26:45,059
Why are you hiding now?

396
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:46,979
What the hell is wrong with you?

397
00:26:47,253 --> 00:26:48,610
Throw another bucket of water in the room.

398
00:26:51,533 --> 00:26:52,826
You finally came out.

399
00:26:55,545 --> 00:26:57,117
You want to be the center of attention, don’t you?

400
00:26:59,154 --> 00:26:59,825
Zen.

401
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,445
Come here.

402
00:27:05,045 --> 00:27:06,314
You two are friends, right?

403
00:27:07,081 --> 00:27:08,610
I’ll tell you something.

404
00:27:08,777 --> 00:27:11,100
Your friend, Zen, is the one who told me about you.

405
00:27:16,091 --> 00:27:20,173
I told you that many boys like Sera.

406
00:27:21,605 --> 00:27:24,217
I just told my dad that I’m going to stay in Thailand.

407
00:27:27,682 --> 00:27:29,294
Lune, aren’t you happy to hear that?

408
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:34,103
(If you want to be the center of attention, I’ll arrange it for you.)

409
00:27:34,625 --> 00:27:36,696
(I’ll make sure you don’t want to go near Sera again.)

410
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:37,616
(Lune.)

411
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,645
(Sera, please leave me alone.)

412
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,034
Here, this is for you.

413
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,706
Today, you got one too, Jewel.

414
00:27:50,472 --> 00:27:55,779
Damn. I want to know who initiated the gift-sending culture.

415
00:27:55,964 --> 00:27:58,912
I only see fans sending gifts to their idols.

416
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,527
Lune, have you ever seen it?

417
00:28:01,099 --> 00:28:02,259
Acutally, I…

418
00:28:02,272 --> 00:28:04,517
White gets so many snacks.

419
00:28:04,531 --> 00:28:06,401
They always ask me to give them to you.

420
00:28:06,472 --> 00:28:09,955
You must be so divine that they can’t give the gifts to you by themselves.

421
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,419
Don’t you know that I come to school every day by flying, not walking?

422
00:28:16,371 --> 00:28:18,831
That’s why your feet are so clean.

423
00:28:18,847 --> 00:28:19,594
Damn.

424
00:28:20,293 --> 00:28:21,957
She sent me a pizza again.

425
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:26,648
Do you want to eat it?

426
00:28:27,069 --> 00:28:27,742
I’ll take this one.

427
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,362
Let me choose one.

428
00:28:30,413 --> 00:28:31,395
Come on.

429
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:33,906
- Here. - Thanks.

430
00:28:34,982 --> 00:28:35,628
Take it, White.

431
00:28:36,376 --> 00:28:37,062
Take it.

432
00:28:38,071 --> 00:28:39,422
I chose the smallest piece.

433
00:28:45,262 --> 00:28:45,911
Lune.

434
00:28:46,954 --> 00:28:47,906
You can share it with me.

435
00:28:48,416 --> 00:28:49,136
I only eat a small bite.

436
00:28:50,282 --> 00:28:51,065
It’s okay.

437
00:28:55,426 --> 00:28:56,010
Really?

438
00:28:58,365 --> 00:29:00,527
You are the first one who took it.

439
00:29:36,505 --> 00:29:37,549
Damn. Master is here.

440
00:29:37,954 --> 00:29:40,841
Put them away.

441
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,309
I’m sorry.

442
00:29:43,866 --> 00:29:46,534
Let’s do the roll call quickly.

443
00:29:46,801 --> 00:29:47,417
Irin.

444
00:29:47,616 --> 00:29:48,223
I’m here.

445
00:29:48,482 --> 00:29:49,260
Darika.

446
00:29:49,377 --> 00:29:50,013
I’m here.

447
00:29:50,328 --> 00:29:51,066
Tiwakorn.

448
00:29:51,087 --> 00:29:51,708
I’m here.

449
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:52,628
Ponthep.

450
00:29:52,899 --> 00:29:53,487
I’m here.

451
00:29:54,453 --> 00:29:55,322
Darapa.

452
00:29:55,968 --> 00:29:56,437
I’m here.

453
00:29:56,454 --> 00:29:57,320
Wait and see.

454
00:29:58,697 --> 00:29:59,407
Nontarat.

455
00:30:00,511 --> 00:30:01,453
Nontarat, are you here?

456
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:09,300
Okay, let’s begin our class.

457
00:30:17,454 --> 00:30:20,000
Okay, this is a wrap for today.

458
00:30:28,678 --> 00:30:29,271
See?

459
00:30:29,788 --> 00:30:32,404
You don’t need to go to the master to take your attendance anymore.

460
00:30:34,285 --> 00:30:35,408
How did you do it?

461
00:30:35,731 --> 00:30:40,805
I just told him to change the font of the name list to be smaller.

462
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,804
So your name would be on the same page with everyone.

463
00:30:43,071 --> 00:30:45,152
If someone else asked him, he wouldn’t do it.

464
00:30:45,368 --> 00:30:46,705
I agreed to do it because of me.

465
00:30:46,777 --> 00:30:48,607
Of course, Mr. Popular.

466
00:30:57,922 --> 00:31:00,266
If you want to be the center of attention, I’ll arrange it for you.

467
00:31:00,371 --> 00:31:02,795
I’ll make sure you don’t want to go near Sera again.

468
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,062
You want to hang out with the popular kids, don’t you?

469
00:31:10,108 --> 00:31:10,869
Jerk.

470
00:31:12,324 --> 00:31:14,397
It’s not about popularity. Anyone can ask him.

471
00:31:14,407 --> 00:31:16,525
It’s because you are popular. That’s why he agreed to your request.

472
00:31:20,499 --> 00:31:21,862
You didn’t need to do it.

473
00:31:23,257 --> 00:31:23,831
Hey.

474
00:31:24,401 --> 00:31:25,383
Lune, where are you going?

475
00:31:26,957 --> 00:31:27,863
What’s wrong with him?

476
00:31:37,225 --> 00:31:38,720
I knew you would be here.

477
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:41,714
Star.

478
00:31:51,551 --> 00:31:53,543
Doesn’t your shirt get dirty if you lay on the ground?

479
00:31:54,721 --> 00:31:55,802
If it’s dirty, I just wash it.

480
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:00,416
That’s right.

481
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:03,660
There’s no need to overthink it.

482
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,069
This feels great.

483
00:32:21,088 --> 00:32:23,410
Now, I know why you like to come here.

484
00:32:32,445 --> 00:32:33,045
Lune.

485
00:32:35,736 --> 00:32:38,349
White really wants to be your friend.

486
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:44,099
I heard that he was begging the teacher to make a new name list.

487
00:32:45,909 --> 00:32:47,420
Since I’ve known White,

488
00:32:48,278 --> 00:32:50,906
I’ve never seen him take something this seriously.

489
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:12,219
Dad.

490
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:13,509
I’m going to school by myself today.

491
00:33:13,521 --> 00:33:14,185
I don’t want to be late.

492
00:33:14,266 --> 00:33:16,208
You never had a problem with being late at school.

493
00:33:16,277 --> 00:33:17,573
Now, I have.

494
00:33:17,687 --> 00:33:19,478
And you don’t need to pick me up at school today.

495
00:33:19,503 --> 00:33:20,210
I’ll come home by myself.

496
00:33:20,226 --> 00:33:20,823
Goodbye.

497
00:33:25,595 --> 00:33:27,177
What’s wrong with him?

498
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:32,930
(Jewel : Let’s meet at the porridge shop. If you arrive first, order a porridge with extra liver for me.)

499
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,530
(Ivy : If you are late, then don’t eat it.)

500
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:40,570
(Star : Lune, this is the address of the shop in case you don’t know.)

501
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:49,610
(I can’t go with you guys.)

502
00:33:49,631 --> 00:33:50,131
Hey.

503
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,648
Do you have time for me?

504
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:56,362
I moved to the other school as you asked me.

505
00:33:56,727 --> 00:33:57,768
I think we have nothing to talk about.

506
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:01,014
You moved to another school but I got expelled.

507
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,121
It was over since then.

508
00:34:04,768 --> 00:34:05,370
Hey.

509
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,524
Where are you going?

510
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:08,623
What do you want?

511
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:10,034
What do I want?

512
00:34:12,614 --> 00:34:14,395
Can I punch your face?

513
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:16,960
Lune.

514
00:34:18,294 --> 00:34:19,142
What the hell are you doing?

515
00:34:20,447 --> 00:34:21,337
Are you alright?

516
00:34:21,416 --> 00:34:22,302
Why are you butting in?

517
00:34:26,082 --> 00:34:26,952
What the hell are you doing?

518
00:34:27,794 --> 00:34:28,509
Jerk.

519
00:34:29,037 --> 00:34:29,805
White!

520
00:34:38,328 --> 00:34:40,324
Zen, wait for us.

521
00:34:40,927 --> 00:34:42,011
Ivy, Star, run away.

522
00:34:45,768 --> 00:34:46,617
Everyone, ready?

523
00:34:47,743 --> 00:34:48,312
One.

524
00:34:49,722 --> 00:34:50,312
Two.

525
00:34:51,204 --> 00:34:52,011
Three. Run!

526
00:34:52,231 --> 00:34:54,011
Run? I thought you would fight.

527
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,514
Wait for me.

528
00:35:05,216 --> 00:35:06,902
Damn you, White? Why didn’t you say we were going to run away?

529
00:35:08,554 --> 00:35:09,702
Star, are you alright?

530
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,004
Damn.

531
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,102
Can you let go of my hand now?

532
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:44,706
Lune, are these your headphones?

533
00:35:45,847 --> 00:35:46,717
They are broken.

534
00:35:49,085 --> 00:35:51,023
It’s okay. I can fix them.

535
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,017
Can you tell me who those boys are?

536
00:35:56,394 --> 00:35:58,017
My friend from junior high school.

537
00:35:58,194 --> 00:35:59,102
We had a fight.

538
00:35:59,623 --> 00:36:00,265
Ouch.

539
00:36:00,468 --> 00:36:01,502
Don’t cry.

540
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,100
This is your punishment for putting Star in danger.

541
00:36:08,647 --> 00:36:09,801
I’m so sorry.

542
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,619
I’m really sorry for causing you the trouble.

543
00:36:13,715 --> 00:36:14,385
It’s okay.

544
00:36:15,195 --> 00:36:15,897
It was fun.

545
00:36:18,404 --> 00:36:19,582
I mean it. It was fun.

546
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:21,979
I’ve never run away from anyone before.

547
00:36:22,211 --> 00:36:23,302
My heart was racing.

548
00:36:26,819 --> 00:36:29,008
How did you find me?

549
00:36:29,674 --> 00:36:33,819
When you said you wouldn’t come, Ivy didn’t let us eat.

550
00:36:34,188 --> 00:36:35,554
She told us to drag you from home.

551
00:36:35,576 --> 00:36:37,931
I almost called Master to ask for your address.

552
00:36:37,951 --> 00:36:41,503
If we waited until we got the address, we wouldn’t have dinner today.

553
00:36:41,614 --> 00:36:43,885
I told you that I saw Lune went home this way.

554
00:36:43,906 --> 00:36:46,213
But we couldn’t walk around without directions.

555
00:36:46,231 --> 00:36:47,454
Right. Are you stupid?

556
00:36:47,554 --> 00:36:51,568
Don’t scold him. Even though he’s stupid, he found Lune.

557
00:36:51,937 --> 00:36:54,348
That’s right. I found him.

558
00:36:54,405 --> 00:36:55,914
You took a long time to find him.

559
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:09,118
If we didn’t go to the porridge shop, this wouldn’t happen.

560
00:37:09,751 --> 00:37:10,811
Let’s have Lune decide.

561
00:37:12,025 --> 00:37:12,900
Lune, what do you want to do?

562
00:37:17,051 --> 00:37:18,205
Why are you crying?

563
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,573
I’m sorry and thank you, all of you.

564
00:37:27,869 --> 00:37:29,408
It’s okay.

565
00:37:30,869 --> 00:37:33,062
We are friends. It’s not a big deal.

566
00:37:39,717 --> 00:37:41,509
But what is not okay is…

567
00:37:44,358 --> 00:37:46,106
I can’t fix your earphones.

568
00:37:47,377 --> 00:37:48,265
I’m sorry.

569
00:37:50,925 --> 00:37:51,579
It’s okay.

570
00:37:52,394 --> 00:37:53,669
I don’t think I need it anymore.

571
00:38:07,893 --> 00:38:09,656
Look at White’s friend.

572
00:38:09,751 --> 00:38:11,617
He’s handsome.

573
00:38:15,819 --> 00:38:18,186
The aces are all together.

574
00:38:18,287 --> 00:38:19,260
Can I take a picture of you?

575
00:38:19,475 --> 00:38:20,697
I may post it on my page this week.

576
00:38:21,059 --> 00:38:21,706
Sure.

577
00:38:21,961 --> 00:38:23,368
Can you stand closer together?

578
00:38:24,185 --> 00:38:25,285
Come to take a picture with us.

579
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:26,365
Come here.

580
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:31,208
(They said high school is a memorable moment of your life.)

581
00:38:31,554 --> 00:38:33,602
(You get to enjoy a small circle of friends.)

582
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:38,405
(Now, a nobody and an invisible man like me have friends like everyone.)

583
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,548
Can you stand closer?

584
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,617
Stop playing games and step closer to me.

585
00:38:51,299 --> 00:38:56,026
(It seems like I’m stepping a bit closer to the star that used to be so far away.)

586
00:38:56,671 --> 00:38:57,376
Are you okay?

587
00:38:59,983 --> 00:39:00,823
Yes.

588
00:39:06,817 --> 00:39:08,887
One, two, three.

589
00:39:10,822 --> 00:39:11,616
Thank you.

590
00:39:21,002 --> 00:39:23,705
Star is so cute.

591
00:39:26,305 --> 00:39:28,277
When people say Star and I look perfect together,

592
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:31,342
I can’t barely hide my smile.

593
00:39:31,466 --> 00:39:32,068
Huh?

594
00:39:34,777 --> 00:39:35,762
I have never told you before.

595
00:39:39,678 --> 00:39:41,317
I have a secret to tell you.

596
00:39:44,675 --> 00:39:45,657
I like Star.

597
00:40:10,672 --> 00:40:11,259
Hey.

598
00:40:11,383 --> 00:40:11,911
Hey.

599
00:40:12,626 --> 00:40:13,509
It’s you again?

600
00:40:13,651 --> 00:40:15,299
If you are splashed again, you can come here.

601
00:40:15,318 --> 00:40:17,860
At Magic Café, I can cast a spell to drive your stress away.

602
00:40:18,066 --> 00:40:20,583
I never knew that you were Paradox’s fans.

603
00:40:20,607 --> 00:40:23,737
No one knows it. Nobody wants to see the real me.

604
00:40:24,022 --> 00:40:24,844
But I do.

605
00:40:26,665 --> 00:40:28,728
Do you think our friends are acting strange?

606
00:40:29,029 --> 00:40:30,219
Lune and Star?

607
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:32,096
I knew it. I’m not the only one who noticed it.

608
00:40:32,205 --> 00:40:34,518
Lune, do you like Star?
